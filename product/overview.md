## Analyses

### Openings / Winrate

**Goal:** Understand which are my weak openings.

An opening is categorized by ECO (e.g. it is provided in the chess.com game info).

We can also provide an interactive opening flow which shows the winrate for each move.

Considerations:

- Game selection criteria.
  - All time / Time frame
  - Rating range (Mine / Oponent)

### Tactic / Mating patterns

**Goal:** Understand which tactical / mating patterns I am most likely to miss.

### Blunders

**Goal:** Centralized view of my critical blunders.

Considerations:

- Categorization? Maybe hanging material / tactical / positional.

### Player card

**Goal:** A radar plot, and a character analysis of strengths and weaknesses.

Categories (TBD):

- Tactical
- Positional
- Endgame
- Openings
- Space
- No blunder
- Clock
